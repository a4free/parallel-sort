A daemon (pid 25005) died unexpectedly with status 255 while attempting
to launch so we are aborting.

There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).

This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared

location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.
