\begin{abstract}

	This paper describes the implementation, testing, and performance analysis of a parallel sorting algorithm, specifically Radix Sort. At first an initial, sequential implementation was created. A shared memory implementation followed, using OpenMP. Finally a distributed memory approach was also tried, with MPI, where the problem of load balancing was also taken into account. This resulted in two different MPI implementations, one with load balacing, and one without it.
