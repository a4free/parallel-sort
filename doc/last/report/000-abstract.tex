\begin{abstract}
Following a previous work where some parallelization libraries were studied, a follow-up is shown in this document, by presenting an comparative analysis with the initial shared memory approach, with OpenMP, against Threading Building Blocks. More than to obtain performance gains, the goal is to analyse implementation details, studying what each library has to offer, and the difficulties it presents. The case study used for analysis is an implementation of the Radix Sort algorithm.
