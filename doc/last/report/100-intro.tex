\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:100}

This document follows on a previous work where a sorting algorithm, in particular Radix Sort, was studied and parallelized in a shared memory approach with OpenMP, and a distributed memory approach with MPI. The follow-up is based on the shared memory implementation, which is now compared against a similar implementation using Intel\tr Threading Building Blocks.

\Cref{sec:200} shows a small description of the algorithm. More details on the algorithm and on previous implementations can be found in \cite{naps62sort}. The particular implementations are explained in \cref{sec:300,sec:400,sec:500}. In \cref{sec:600,sec:700}, methodology and testing environment are described, with some results being shown on \cref{sec:700}. Finally some conclusions are gathered on \cref{sec:900}.
