\section{Radix Sort}
\label{sec:200}

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that works on integer or string keys. The ordering is done by grouping keys into buckets, according to their individual digits.\\

The approach used here is the \emph{Least Significant Digit} one, which is iterative in nature, running through all the elements once for every digit


As a small example, consider the following list of integers:

\begin{lstlisting}
	arr = [170, 45, 75, 90, 24, 2, 66]
\end{lstlisting}

In the first iteration, the least significant digit is considered. After sending each key into the correct bucket, the result is the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
	0: [170, 90],
	2: [2],
	4: [24],
	5: [45, 75],
	6: [66]
\end{lstlisting}

And after merging all buckets:

\begin{lstlisting}
	arr = [170, 90, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]
\end{lstlisting}

This completes the first iteration. The process is repeated until there are no more digits do process.
