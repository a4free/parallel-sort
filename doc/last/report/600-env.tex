\section{Environmental Setup}
\label{sec:600}

All tests were run on the SeARCH cluster

All tests described in this document were performed using a very specific subset of nodes from the SeARCH\footnote{\url{http://search.di.uminho.pt}}, here referred as SeARCH Group Hex.
For each test, a single node was fully reserved, to ensure full access to all the resources.

Nodes in SeARCH Group Hex have two hex-core processors (with Intel\tr Hyper-threading\tm technology) and 12 to 48 GB of RAM.Further detail regarding the hardware of these nodes can be found in \cref{tab:grouphex}.
